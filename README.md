# CA_PCA_sobel_edge_detector
this is a set of project which is for the computer architecture and parallel computing

1, Parallel programming model for Sobel Edge Detector: Implemented a sobel edge detector 
algorithm written in C to detect image edge. Applied a hybrid parallel programming model with 
MPI and OpenMP to improve the performance of detector.
2, LULESH case study: Ported LULESH challenge problem on Supercomputer (HiperGator), 
analyzed different programming model (MPI, OpenMP, CUDA) performance.
3, Used GEM5 simulator to analyze high performance computer with different cache replacement 
policies and CPU models
