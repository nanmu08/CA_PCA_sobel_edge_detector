# CA_PCA_sobel_edge_detector
this is a set of project which is for the computer architecture and parallel computing

•	Implemented Sobel edge detector algorithm which coded in C to detect image edge. Developed multithreading and multiprocessing model with MPI and OpenMP to improve concurrent ability.
•	Ported LULESH challenge problem program on Supercomputer, analyzed different programming model (MPI, OpenMP, CUDA) performance.
•	Created configuration script which coded in python to model x86 and ARM microprocessor in GEM5 simulator, analyzed performance with different cache replacement policies and CPU models.
